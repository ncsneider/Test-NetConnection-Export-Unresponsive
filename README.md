# Test-NetConnection-Export-Unresponsive
This script is designed to ping a list of IP addresses referencing a .csv file and output another .csv file highlighting the IP's that didn't respond. We are currently working on two builds, one that focuses on automation and one that allows for specifiying a uniqe file and export location for the data everytime.

This is a project that is being worked on in collaboration with @TheD4rkSide who has been with me throughout the whole project save for the the idea to build it!
